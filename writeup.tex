\author{Reed Foster}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    In this work, an InGaZnO (IGZO) thin film transistor (TFT) common-gate amplifier and a TFT small signal model are demonstrated.
    The fabricated amplifier achieves a DC gain of nearly 2 and 3dB bandwidth of roughly 30kHz.
    The model integrates the intrinsic parasitic capacitances of the amplifier and accurately predicts the experimentally measured frequency response when the measurement apparatus parasitics are considered.

\section{Introduction}
Amorphous thin film transistors are simple to fabricate and can be constructed on flexible substrates, making them a great platform for inexpensive wearable or embedded systems.
InGaZnO (IGZO) is a popular material for thin film transistors due to its relatively high mobility and ease of fabrication\cite{Nomura}.
Monolithic integration of analog and digital systems in IGZO could provide a solution for embedded/wearable computing and sensing,
but in order to enable the design of analog circuits in a new material system,
engineers need accurate models that quantitatively predict the behavior of their circuits across all frequencies.
Typically, this is done with a small signal model of the transistor: a local linear approximation of the transistor around some operating point that includes an intrinsic transconductance and output resistance as well as parasitic capacitance and resistance.
An accurate small signal model for a single transistor amplifier would capture virtually all of the parameters needed to model the behavior of complex, multi-transistor circuits.

To benchmark the accuracy of the small signal model, a common gate amplifier is fabricated in a three mask IGZO top gate process.
The DC current-voltage characteristics of the process are measured to extract the DC small signal parameters of the amplifier core, while the small signal capacitances are estimated based on device geometry and materials.
The small signal parameters are de-embedded from the IGZO parasitic sheet resistance, following a procedure similar to \cite{Cheng}.
The model is then compared with the experimentally measured frequency response of the common-gate amplifer.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Common Gate Amplifier}

The common gate amplifier configuration is often used in CMOS radio-frequency (RF) applications due to its real input impedance and ability to operate near its transit frequency $f_T$ \cite{Razavi}.
While there's no gate-drain overlap capacitance $C_{gd}$ in the top-gate thin film transistor process used in this work
(and thus the degradation in bandwidth typically observed in a common source amplifier due to the Miller effect would be negligible),
a common gate amplifier was chosen over the common source configuration to minimize overlap with the projects of other students.
A circuit schematic of the common gate configuration is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:commongate}:

\end{figure}


Unlike in traditional MOSFETs, thin film transistors typically have large contact resistance and depending on their geometry, little to no overlap capacitance \cite{Cheng}.%,\cite{Holland}.
In order to accurately model this effect, a new small signal model needs to be used which accounts for elevated contact resistance.
Fig. \ref{fig:capacitances} shows the various parasitic resistances and capacitances present in the top gate IGZO transistors.
The Si substrate resistance $R_{sub}$ is calculated assuming a resistivity of 100$\Omega$cm, which assumes that the substrate has been lightly doped with Boron (roughly 10$^{14}$/cm$^3$ \cite{NIST}).
The capacitances $C_{Ssub}$ and $C_{Dsub}$ are lumped capacitances to model the distributed capacitance between the bottom of the IGZO transistor channel and the substrate.
$R_C$, $R_S$, and $R_D$ model the IGZO-Mo contact resistance and IGZO source/drain extension sheet resistance (respectively).
The parasitics are combined to form the small signal model shown in Fig. \ref{fig:tftsmallsignal}.

Since the contact and sheet resistance affect the measured IV characteristics, the intrinsic transconductance $g_{mi}$ and output resistance $r_{oi}$ must be de-embedded from the measured extrinsic transconductance $g_m$ and output resistance $r_o$.
The intrinsic small signal parameters can be de-embedded by following a similar procedure to \cite{Cheng}, without making the simplifying assumption that $R_S = R_D$:

\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
    g_m & = & \frac{\partial I_D}{\partial V_{GS}},~~ r_o = \frac{\partial V_{DS}}{\partial I_D} \\
    r_{oi} & = & r_o-R_D-(1+g_mr_o)R_S \\
    g_{mi} & = & g_m\frac{r_o}{r_{oi}}
    \label{eqn:intrinicparameters}
\end{IEEEeqnarray}

Fig. \ref{fig:smallsignal} shows a complete small signal model of the amplifier:

\section{Device Fabrication}

The common gate amplifier was fabricated with two transistors that share an IGZO mesa as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:fab} and \ref{fig:probestation}.
Both transistors have a 5$\mu$m channel with 2$\mu$m ungated source/drain extensions.
The active transistor M$_1$ is 80$\mu$m wide and the load transistor M$_2$ is 30$\mu$m wide.
Fig. \ref{fig:fab} shows the steps of the fabrication process.
The devices were fabricated on a 6" p-type silicon wafer (Fig. \ref{fig:fab1}).
Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition was used to deposit 420nm of SiO$_2$ on the wafer surface for electrical isolation from the substrate (Fig. \ref{fig:fab2}).
Then, 8nm of IGZO was RF sputtered at 100W with flowrates of 20sccm Ar and 1sccm O$_2$ at 1mtorr (Fig. \ref{fig:fab3}).
AZ3312 photoresist and AZ726 developer were used for photolithography of the IGZO.
The exposed IGZO was etched with 1:9 HCl:H$_2$O for 10s to form the transistor channel (Fig. \ref{fig:fab4}).
To form the gate oxide and IGZO passivation, 30nm of Al$_2$O$_3$ was deposited with atomic layer deposition (Fig. \ref{fig:fab5}).
The oxide vias were patterned with 10um AZ10XT photoresist and AZ435 developer.
After a 7min spin-rinse with the developer, the remaining AZ10XT and Al$_2$O$_3$ were etched in a bath of AZ435 for an additional 20min (Fig. \ref{fig:fab6}).
Next, 30nm of Mo was sputtered at 100W with 15sccm Ar at 2mtorr (Fig. \ref{fig:fab7}).
Finally, the Mo was patterned with 1um thick AZ3312 photoresist and AZ726 developer.
The exposed Mo was peroxide etched to form the metal contacts for the gate, drain, and source of the transistor (Fig. \ref{fig:fab8}).

\section{Device Characterization and Testing}

\subsection{DC Characteristics of IGZO Process}
A Keysight B1500A semiconductor device analyzer was used to measure the DC current-voltage characteristics of the individual 80$\mu$m/5$\mu$m and 30$\mu$m/5$\mu$m transistors as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ivmeasure}.
The semiconductor analyzer was also used to measure the contact and sheet resistance of the IGZO film using a series of two-point measurements on IGZO resistors of various dimensions.

\subsection{DC Gain and Bandwidth of Common Gate Amplifier}
The common gate amplifier is configured as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:cg} with the 80$\mu$m/5$\mu$m transistor (M$_1$) used as the amplifying transistor and the 30$\mu$m/5$\mu$m transistor (M$_2$) as an active load.
The differential DC gain $\Delta V_{out}/\Delta V_{in}$ was measured with the semiconductor device analyzer across a wide range of bias points to determine the optimal point for maximum gain.

    \label{fig:measurementsetup}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:freqmeasure} shows a setup schematic for measurement of the amplifier's frequency response.
The frequency response of the common gate amplifier was measured with a Keysight DSOX2014A oscilloscope and a Keysight 33520A 80MHz function generator.
The function generator was set to produce a sinusoidal tone with a 200mV$_{\text{pp}}$ output swing connected to the input terminal of the amplifier.
The oscilloscope was used to measure the function generator output as well as the output of the amplifier.
The amplitude ratio and relative phase of the input and output signals were measured for frequencies from 500Hz to 1MHz.
The DC biases $V_{b1}$, $V_{b2}$, and $V_{DD}$ were set with the source-measurement units of the semiconductor analyzer in standby mode.

\section{Results}

The sheet and contact resistances $R_S$, $R_D$, and $R_C$ used in the small signal model (Fig. \ref{fig:tftsmallsignal}) were extracted from Fig. \ref{fig:igzoresistance}.
The slope of the resistance vs. IGZO rectangle aspect ratio gives the sheet resistance in $\Omega/\square$ and the y-intercept is twice the contact resistance between the Mo and IGZO.
The bulk resistivity and contact resistance were estimated to be $\rho \approx 0.06\Omega\cdot$cm (good agreement with literature \cite{Hsu}) and $\rho_C \approx 0.022\Omega\cdot$cm$^2$.

\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:ivcharacteristics} shows the measured IV characteristics of the 80$\mu$m/5$\mu$m and 30$\mu$m/5$\mu$m devices.
Both demonstrate an $I_{\text{on}}/I_{\text{off}}$ ratio of about 10$^5$ and some amount of finite output resistance.
The current density (normalized to the transistor width) for the same bias point was substantially lower for the 30$\mu$m device than the 80$\mu$m device.
This is most likely due to the higher resistance of the 2$\mu$m source/drain extensions for the 30$\mu$m wide device.
The extrinsic small signal parameters $g_{m}$ and $r_{o}$ were extracted from the full set of IV data and equation \ref{eqn:intrinicparameters} was used to de-embed the intrinsic parameters $g_{mi}$ and $r_{oi}$.
The product $g_{mi}r_{oi}$ is plotted for each transistor in Fig. \ref{fig:intrinsic_gain}. $g_{mi}r_{oi}$ is the intrinsic gain of a transistor, and is the maximum possible DC voltage gain of a single transistor amplifier constructed with an ideal source and load.

\section{Discussion}
%The measured bulk resistivity is roughly in agreement with literature values \cite{Lee}, \cite{Hsu}.
%As demonstrated in \cite{Park}, the resistivity of IGZO can change over orders of magnitude if treated with Ar plasma,
%so the level of agreement is reasonable.

\subsection{Small Signal Model Agreement With Experiment}

Fig. \ref{fig:smallsignal_results} shows that the small signal model correctly predicts the low frequency ($<$1kHz) gain of the amplifier quite well for the different bias points.
However, in Fig. \ref{fig:smallsignal_1xCpad}, the model overestimates the cutoff frequency of the amplifier by about 60x.
The dominant capacitance is the amplifier output node capacitance between the Mo pad and the Si substrate, and is approximately 1.7pF.
The capacitance between the IGZO channel and silicon substrate, while included in the small signal model for completeness sake, did not have a noticeable effect on the first two poles of the amplifier transfer function.
The only capacitances not accounted for in the model are the fringing capacitance between the metal contacts and the capacitance of the measurement equipment.
This fringing capacitance should be orders of magnitude lower than any of the other capacitances, and can be neglected.
However, due to the construction of the triaxial cables used with the semiconductor analyzer SMUs, they can have relatively high capacitance (as much as 90-380pF/m of cable depending on how the central guard shield is terminated in the triax-coax adapter) \cite{Tektronix}.
A load capacitance presented by the measurement equipment of just 60pF would explain the inaccuracy of the small signal model (Fig. \ref{fig:smallsignal_70xCpad}).
Therefore, the cutoff frequency of the fabricated amplifier structure should be about 1.7-1.8MHz for the same bias points (based on Fig. \ref{fig:smallsignal_1xCpad}).
If the large Mo pads used for measurement weren't included in the layout, i.e. in an integrated setting where the amplifier is driving some other onchip components, the cutoff frequency could be as high as 6MHz based on the other intrinsic capacitances in the device.
In order to verify that the amplifier can actually function at such high frequencies, more experiments with specialized equipment, such as a network analyzer (which could calibrate out the cable capacitance), would need to be done.

\subsection{Proper Load Selection}

As configured in Fig. \ref{fig:cg}, the gain of this device as predicted by the small signal model is relatively poor compared to the device intrinsic gain.
This is because the load is effectively in a common gate configuration, and thus presents a load impedance of:
\begin{IEEEeqnarray}{rCl}
    Z_L(\omega = 0) & = & R_S + \frac{R_D + r_{oi}}{1+g_{mi}r_{oi}} = \frac{1+g_mr_oR_S+r_o}{1+g_m(R_S+r_o)} \\
    & \approx & R_S + \frac{1}{g_m} ~~ (g_mr_o \gg g_mR_S, 1)
\end{IEEEeqnarray}

If the load transistor were diode connected with the gate and source shorted together, then its input impedance would be $r_{o2}$, and the DC gain would likely be closer to the maximum gain allowed by the transistor intrinsic gain $g_{m1}(r_{o1}||r_{o2})$.
Based on the intrinsic gain $g_{mi}r_{oi}$ in Fig. \ref{fig:intrinsic_gain}, this could be as high as 10, or even 20 for a similar level of bias current.
